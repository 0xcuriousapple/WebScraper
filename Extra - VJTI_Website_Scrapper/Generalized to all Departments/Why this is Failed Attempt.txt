Failed Attempt :
    I was trying to genralize web scraping to all departments, but they all dont have common semantics.
    So for each department one will have to write differnet scrapper as each department page have differnet structure.
    for example 
    Order of columns in table : Designation is first in civil while name is first in comp
    There is no column for photo in comp
    Specialisation in electrical is written as Specilization in civil and [MS]Specialization in comp
    Extension in Civil and Electrical is written as Phone in Comp
    We can solve this naming conflict by hard-coding but there are conflicts in structure of HTML too
    Content in <span> in civil while in <p> for electrical.
    and many more...
